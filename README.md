# train_unhealthy_dataset  
we recognize the dataset with noise or inbalanced class to be unhealthy which may lead DNN to overfitting
---

In this rep, we use CIFAR-10 as the basic dataset and CIFAR-10 Noise.   
We use ITLM and Focal loss to deal with the noisy labels and inbalanced classes.  
Also, we introduce several methods of Data Augmentation, including SMOTE, two-stage and re-weighting
